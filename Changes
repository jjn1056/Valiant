The following logs changes for the CPAN distribution Valiant

0.001008 2021 September 14
          - More changes to the way the exporter works.   Shouldn't break anything but this
          change will setup the code to be more compatible with Object::Pad, which is the
          sketch for Cor, the possible new Perl object system.  This way we start the process
          of being Cor friendly.
          - Some documentation cleanup and additions around how internationalized works. Its
          still underdocumented (volunteers very welcomed).

          - !!! Totally changed the way we aggregate validations and filters from subclasses
          and roles.   All the same validations will run but the run order is likely 
          different.  THIS COULD BE A BREAKING CHANGE for you if you have code that is
          validation order dependent (could be in your test cases for example).  I did warn you
          that validation order was subject to change :)  On a positive note after working thru
          this with mst I think order is a lot more firmed up.  I still consider it subject to
          change but I will now only change it if I need to in order to address critical design
          or secure or performance issues.
          - !!! Removed for now some experimental introspection code.   It wasn't documented
          and if you used it your code is now broken.  Contact me with your use case so I can
          plan a sane API for this.
          - Confirmation validator now skips when either the confirmation value or
          check value is not defined.  This prevents showing a confirmation error
          when both values are not defined which I think is correct but its a minor
          breaking change.  
          - Lots more test cases are DBIC nesting.
          - Normalized how translations key names are looked up and documented that.  Its also
          not impossible I introduced a breaking change if you are using translation tags with
          lots of weird nesting.

0.001006  2021 April 19
          - Possible fix for issue where windows doesn't find locale paths

0.001005  2021 April 18
          - Declare column validations inside a column definition for DBIC
          - lots of tweaks and fixes to now nested validations for DBIC work
          - Start on having CCI for Windows and MacOS
          - Stubbed out a lot of the docs needed for Valiant::DBIC
          - improved the Catalyst example using DBIC with Valiant
          - Allowed one to set a context on a model before running the validation
          - enabled some debugging for test cases to help me fix the Windows issue.  If 
            anyone has access to Strawberry Perl on Windows and wants to help me make 
            this work on Windows please give me a shout!

0.001004  2021 April 07
          - Specify more exact dependency versions in cpanfile.
          - lots of updates to nested DBIC support and improved example application

0.001003  2021 March 04
          - Allow one to disable auto validation on DBIC classes.  This allows
          you to insert or update rows that are invalid.
          - Added some test cases for strict mode validations and allowed one a
          bit more control over strict mode messaging.

0.001002  2021 February 25
          - quick followup that just fixes POD issues

0.001001  2021 February 25
          - First Post!  Please only use this if you are ready to help
          file bug reports and read all the docs carefully.
          - This release is dedicated to my dog Tornado who we lost to
          cancer on 18 August 2020.
